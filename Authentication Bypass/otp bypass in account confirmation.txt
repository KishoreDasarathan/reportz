Authentication Bypass - Email Verification code bypass in account registration process.

Summary :
Authentication Bypass is a dangerous vulnerability, which is found in Web-Applications. An Attackers can bypass the control mechanisms which are used by the underlying web application like Email verification, OTP, Captcha, 2FA, etc. An Attacker can perform a  complete Account takeover of Victim.

Steps to Reproduce:

1) Go to https://my.jpesa.com/
2) create an account 
3) Enter the mobile and Email 
4) It sends an otp 
5) Enter any 6 digit code and click verify and capture the request 
6) Then Send this request to burpsuite intruder , and bruteforce the confirmation Code 
7) look for 200 ok response 
Now successfully Account Verified.

Impact:
A successful OTP bypass attack can erode user trust in the security of the application. Users expect OTPs to provide an additional layer of security, and a breach of this mechanism can lead to a loss of confidence in the application's ability to protect their accounts and data.

Mitigation:
Enforce rate limiting on OTP verification requests to prevent attackers from making multiple attempts within a short period. Limiting the number of OTP verification attempts per IP address or per user account can mitigate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. Implement account lockout mechanisms that temporarily suspend user accounts after a certain number of failed OTP verification attempts. This prevents attackers from continuously attempting to guess OTPs and provides an additional barrier against brute-force attacks.
